Found the relationship between bvoc to co2 concentration, which is an exp function with a maximum cutting.

Found the relationship between siaq to co2 concentration, which is a piecewise linear function.

From the plot co2_res_05044, the function between resistance and temperature and co2 concentration is confirmed. The task remaining is to determinate the A parameter in the formula, denoted usually by bsec_a later.

Summerized bsec_b, bsec_c and two lrs from history data. Fix bsec_b to 3372\pm40, bsec_c to 4634\pm200, lr1 to 0.00184, lr2 to 0.00012.

Collected more data. Tried finite states machine but failed.

Pick up this work again. Clean up files and codes.

I am going to try this using a neural network. To this end, I will first test NN's ability of fitting exp and log, which may appear in bsec's real formula.
