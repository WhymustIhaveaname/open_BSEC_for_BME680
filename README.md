# open_BSEC_for_BME680
BME680 is a gas sensor produced by Bosch. It claims that it can gives IAQ(indoor air quilty) and CO2 concentration(in ppm). However, actually, it can only gives a gas resistence in Ohm. Customers needs a close-source user-unfriendly software BSEC(Bosch Software Environmental Cluster) to get IAQ and CO2 from gas resistence.
