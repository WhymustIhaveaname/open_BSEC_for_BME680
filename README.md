# Open BSEC for BME680

### Abstract
BME680 is a gas sensor produced by Bosch. It claims that it can give IAQ(indoor air quilty) and CO2 equivalents(in ppm), as well as many other gas indexes, include bVOC(breath VOC) and s-IAQ(static IAQ). However, it can only give a gas resistance in Ohm. Customers need a closed-source user-unfriendly software BSEC(Bosch Software Environmental Cluster) to get IAQ and CO2 from gas resistance. In this repository the mechanism of BME680 and the behavior of BSEC are studied thoroughly. Then an open-source substitution for BSEC is provided.

### How BME680 works

### bVOC, s-IAQ as a function of CO2 equivalents

### How CO2 equivalents is calculated
